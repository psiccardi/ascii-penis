# Ascii PENIS
## Usage
Clone this repository into your local machine.
Go inside the folder ascii-penis.
There are two ways to use the executable:

* type "./penis" and press enter
* type "./penis <number>", where <number> is a number between 0 and 20

The first one prints an ascii-penis of variable length, with length between 0 and 20 (from a micropenis to a very large penis), while the second prints a penis of the specified length.
Enjoy!

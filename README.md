# Ascii PENIS

Funny home made project to learn about bash code

## __Set up__
- Choose a folder project in your system and switch in `cd [folder path]`
- Clone the repo in your folder `git clone https://github.com/useless-programmer/ascii-penis.git`

## __Usage__
There are three ways to use the script:

print a random ascii penis
```bash
./penis
```


print an ascii penis with a choosen height:
```bash
./penis arg1
```
`arg1` is an integer between 0 and 20


print an ascii penis with a choosen height and a choosen width:
```bash
./penis arg1 arg2
```
`arg1` is an integer between 0 and 20
`arg2` is an integer between 1 and 3



You will love the ascii-penis generator, from a micropenis to a very large penis!
Actually we have THREE DIFFERENT shapes for the penis: discover them!

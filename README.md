# Ascii PENIS
## Usage
Clone this repository into your local machine.
Go inside the folder ascii-penis.
There are three ways to use the executable:

* type "./penis" and press enter
* type "./penis \<number\>", where \<number\> is a number between 0 and 20
* type "./penis \<number1\> \<number2\>", where \<number1\> is a number between 0 and 20, and <number2> is 1 or 2

The first one prints an ascii-penis of variable length and variable width, with length between 0 and 20 (from a micropenis to a very large penis), the second prints a penis of the specified length and variable width, and the third one prints a penis of specific width (\<number1\>) and specific height (\<number2\>).
Actually we have THREE DIFFERENT shapes for the penis: discover them!
Enjoy!
